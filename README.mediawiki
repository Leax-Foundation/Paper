=Abstract=
There is no doubt that the real estate market is the most stable investment, with a greater margin
of profits and lower risks of loss. This is what makes it so attractive to investors – be they
experienced or novices.

Why is investing in real estate so safe? Basically, we can say that there is security in this type of
investment for two reasons: great appreciation and hardly any depreciation over time.
Besides, the majority of people not only see the purchase of a property as the guarantee of having
a home but also as a way of owning an asset without having to worry about paying a rent, for
instance.

In the end, it is much easier to realize the importance of having a property – whether for
investment or for own use. Such certainty runs into one of the biggest problems we have
nowadays: bureaucracy and the high costs of real estate, especially in big cities
Concerning bureaucracy, we can say with optimism that technology and the new way of seeing
transactions might change the scenario in few years. Financing approval only for those who have a
high income and the need of numerous documents prevents the process from occurring in a fluid
and optimized way for both sides.

Where does technology come to solve all this? The ones who know the new cryptocurrency and
the Blockchain have already got an idea of the changes that are to come. The co-working
platforms, like the ones we present in this document, facilitate all the processes and real estate
negotiations – and the forecast is very optimistic.
This type of transaction relies on the guarantee that they will not be tampered or altered,
transforming the real estate process in something more intuitive, less bureaucratic and expensive,
besides privacy, security and agility.

This management will be done on Leaxcoin platform, being extremely safe for both parts.
Nowadays, we have real estate transactions that last up to six months but they could be handled
in a matter of days or even in hours with the new technologies.
Next, we introduce LEAXCOIN, a decentralized platform in a global community format with the
evolution of Blockchain in the real estate industry.

=Executive Summary=

'''Imagine that you can conduct a real estate transaction without the need of any type of
intermediation, either by banks or third parts.'''

This is a reality knocking at the door of new crypt-coin investors, just like Leaxcoin. Our main
purpose is to have a focus of action through our platform and create a safe, fast and effective
environment.

Moreover, our focus will be on the real estate sector, which suffers with cumbersome bureaucracy
– real estate processes which hamper trade, for instance, and gradually become more expensive.
Additionally, we will also work on real estate transfers and make the transparence of peer-to-peer
transactions possible, always respecting the jurisdiction of every country where the negotiation
takes place.

The cryptocurrency will be the used for payment within our platform. Through this process, real
estate buyers and sellers will be able to negotiate their properties without any kind of
intermediary and, at the same time, will receive their payment anywhere in the world with
absolute guarantee.

'''This is what we call decentralized operations nowadays – which do not need any bank as a
mediator.'''

The Leaxcoin has emerged to be much more than a simple transactional crypto currency, as well
as a utility token that feeds the entire Leaxcoin platform. It comprises:

<blockquote>  
'''Market without intermediaries'''
A non-bank and non-intermediary market. A reliable and autonomous community that will
assist with all the transactions and conflicts or problems that might occur. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''ICO - Initial Coin Offering'''
The Leaxcoin (LEAX) will be distributed to the ICO participants in a ratio of 1 LEAX to
0.0001 ETH based on the quotation of the day – in the initial contribution period, which is
expected to start on 26/07/2018
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''Limited Distribution'''
The initial contribution period will last 90 days or less than 24 hours in case the o
1,000,000,000 LEAX ceiling is reached
</blockquote>

The cryptocurrency Leaxcoin is much more than a platform! It is a global community where the
real estate transactions are assisted and supported by several programmes, such as our
Ambassador programme, in which the community ambassadors will offer all the legal solutions in
every country of operation, thus establishing the integration with the Leaxcoin technology.

==Differential==

In the Leaxcoin community, we will promote solid integration with organizations and local real
estate registry offices so as to have the Leaxcoin Smart Contract accepted as a legal buy-sell
document, as well as a legal representation in the transfer of those properties.

Every change, partnership, innovation and creation of new products on our platform will always
be voted by the community members, as we know that we will only create something really solid
and memorable with the support and participation of our Leaxcoin community.

=THE CURRENT SCENARIO=

'''The current real estate scenario could not be better. There are over 217 trillion dollars for
the area development! Only in 2017, the volume of global transactions reached 750 billion
dollars!'''

[[File:paper/images/market.png|Real Estate Market.]]

Being aware of the dimension of this scenario, we believe that it offers a lot of opportunities,
especially with the evolution of technology. After all, it has not been so explored yet. Who offers
digital transactions to buy and sell real estates nowadays?

The development we have seen so far are just a drop in the ocean, compared to what we will see
over the next few years.

The technology adopted by the real estate managers nowadays is the 2.0 version, where all the
registry process of a property is done without any connectivity or standardization in several
underdeveloped countries, every time generating higher taxes and slower processes.

'''WHAT IS TO COME IS WHAT WE WANT TO SET UP: A NEW WAY OF PROMOTING THE
EVOLUTION OF THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR THROUGH LEAXCOIN, TO UPDATE THE WAYS THE
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT, UPGRADING THESE PROCEDURES TO A 3.0
VERSION. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE DECLARING, REGISTERING AND TRADING REAL
ESTATES WITH ANYONE ON THIS PLANET.'''
