=Abstract=
There is no doubt that the real estate market is the most stable investment, with a greater margin of profits and lower risks of loss. This is what makes it so attractive to investors – be they experienced or novices.

Why is investing in real estate so safe? Basically, we can say that there is security in this type of investment for two reasons: great appreciation and hardly any depreciation over time. 

Besides, the majority of people not only see the purchase of a property as the guarantee of having a home but also as a way of owning an asset without having to worry about paying a rent, for instance.

In the end, it is much easier to realize the importance of having a property – whether for investment or for own use. Such certainty runs into one of the biggest problems we have nowadays: bureaucracy and the high costs of real estate, especially in big cities Concerning bureaucracy, we can say with optimism that technology and the new way of seeing transactions might change the scenario in few years. Financing approval only for those who have a high income and the need of numerous documents prevents the process from occurring in a fluid and optimized way for both sides.

Where does technology come to solve all this? The ones who know the new cryptocurrency and the Blockchain have already got an idea of the changes that are to come. The co-working platforms, like the ones we present in this document, facilitate all the processes and real estate negotiations – and the forecast is very optimistic. This type of transaction relies on the guarantee that they will not be tampered or altered, transforming the real estate process in something more intuitive, less bureaucratic and expensive, besides privacy, security and agility.

This management will be done on Leaxcoin platform, being extremely safe for both parts. Nowadays, we have real estate transactions that last up to six months but they could be handled in a matter of days or even in hours with the new technologies. Next, we introduce LEAXCOIN, a decentralized platform in a global community format with the evolution of Blockchain in the real estate industry.

=Executive Summary=

'''Imagine that you can conduct a real estate transaction without the need of any type of intermediation, either by banks or third parts.'''

This is a reality knocking at the door of new crypt-coin investors, just like Leaxcoin. Our main purpose is to have a focus of action through our platform and create a safe, fast and effective environment.

Moreover, our focus will be on the real estate sector, which suffers with cumbersome bureaucracy – real estate processes which hamper trade, for instance, and gradually become more expensive. Additionally, we will also work on real estate transfers and make the transparence of peer-to-peer transactions possible, always respecting the jurisdiction of every country where the negotiation takes place.

The cryptocurrency will be the used for payment within our platform. Through this process, real estate buyers and sellers will be able to negotiate their properties without any kind of intermediary and, at the same time, will receive their payment anywhere in the world with absolute guarantee.

'''This is what we call decentralized operations nowadays – which do not need any bank as a mediator.'''

The Leaxcoin has emerged to be much more than a simple transactional crypto currency, as well as a utility token that feeds the entire Leaxcoin platform. It comprises:

<blockquote>  
'''Market without intermediaries''' 
A non-bank and non-intermediary market. A reliable and autonomous community that will assist with all the transactions and conflicts or problems that might occur. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''ICO - Initial Coin Offering''' 
The Leaxcoin (LEAX) will be distributed to the ICO participants in a ratio of 1 LEAX to 0.0001 ETH based on the quotation of the day – in the initial contribution period, which is expected to start on 26/07/2018
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''Limited Distribution''' 
The initial contribution period will last 90 days or less than 24 hours in case the o 1,000,000,000 LEAX ceiling is reached.
</blockquote>

The cryptocurrency Leaxcoin is much more than a platform! It is a global community where the real estate transactions are assisted and supported by several programmes, such as our Ambassador programme, in which the community ambassadors will offer all the legal solutions in every country of operation, thus establishing the integration with the Leaxcoin technology.

==Differential==

In the Leaxcoin community, we will promote solid integration with organizations and local real estate registry offices so as to have the Leaxcoin Smart Contract accepted as a legal buy-sell document, as well as a legal representation in the transfer of those properties.

Every change, partnership, innovation and creation of new products on our platform will always be voted by the community members, as we know that we will only create something really solid and memorable with the support and participation of our Leaxcoin community.

=The Current Scenario=

'''The current real estate scenario could not be better. There are over 217 trillion dollars for the area development! Only in 2017, the volume of global transactions reached 750 billion dollars!'''

[[File:Images/market.png|Real Estate Market.]]

Being aware of the dimension of this scenario, we believe that it offers a lot of opportunities, especially with the evolution of technology. After all, it has not been so explored yet. Who offers digital transactions to buy and sell real estates nowadays?

The development we have seen so far are just a drop in the ocean, compared to what we will see over the next few years.

The technology adopted by the real estate managers nowadays is the 2.0 version, where all the registry process of a property is done without any connectivity or standardization in several underdeveloped countries, every time generating higher taxes and slower processes.

'''WHAT IS TO COME IS WHAT WE WANT TO SET UP: A NEW WAY OF PROMOTING THE EVOLUTION OF THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR THROUGH LEAXCOIN, TO UPDATE THE WAYS THE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT, UPGRADING THESE PROCEDURES TO A 3.0 VERSION. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE DECLARING, REGISTERING AND TRADING REAL ESTATES WITH ANYONE ON THIS PLANET.'''

In fact, technologies have exponentially grown and had an impact on billions of people all over the world. Whereas we had to go to agencies to transfer money, take out loans, even to pay our bills in the past, now we can have all this in one place. We just have to have our cell phones connected to the internet.

Technological advances have enabled the automation of the whole banking process, making services cheaper and more accessible to billions of people who could not access them before. However, the real estate sector is far behind the curve when it comes to adopting new technology. There is certainly still ample room for this, awaiting several opportunities.

In the current real estate market scenario, there are still disagreements between the parts with regard to contracts and transactions. Even a simple real estate lease is difficult to understand by both parts.



=What is Leaxcoin=

<blockquote> ''' "Forget about the problems about real estate transactions. A strong currency to be expanded all over the World!” '''<blockquote> 

'''LEAXCOIN'''

Leaxcoin is the cryptocurrency that comes with the solution to all the problems related to real estate transactions – whether in buying, renting, leasing, launching or even in registering properties.

The success of the Leaxcoin platform will be totally achieved with a global community, founders, ambassadors, members, real estate specialists and experienced developers, who integrate, with the necessary tools, into all the real estate processes and regulatory agencies of property registration for the blockchain. Everything complies with the countless jurisdictions of every country, state and city.

The Leaxcoin will be used for several things in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, we can say with absolute certainty that the Leaxcoin is a unique opportunity for growth, especially now, with the virtual currency market in constant and significant growth.

[[File:Images/smart_contract.png|Leaxcoin Process in Plataform.]]

=The Tiring Experience of Real Estate Negotiations=


== The Problem ==

'''Despite the potential real estate profits, we know that it is not easy to buy a property.'''

In addition to a great amount of time to find what they want, keen buyers are forced to enter their data into portals and third parts, thus increasing the costs, reducing innovation and inhibiting potential investors and buyers of the sector.

When a transaction involves the purchase of foreign real estates, the process becomes more complicated and its conclusion drags on, which might take months of negotiation and a lot of bureaucracy and government paperwork until everything is concluded or unsuccessful, due to the tiring process.

Without considering whether a property is traded in its country of origin or not, it is true that its transaction – either the sale or the purchase or rent – brings several problems.

In order to maximize the benefits and minimize the losses that people might suffer, we have the solution to the problems through the efforts of Leaxcoin and our community.



===Current trade problems===


====High Capital Requirements====

Real state is usually very expensive and requires the investor/buyer to have high levels of capital. 
For this reason, this market ends up driving away small real estate investors.


====Strict Financial Regulations for Access to Finance====

Finance application is a time consuming process, especially because it is too bureaucratic.
Moreover, the requirement of documents to prove the investor’s buying power results in unnecessary costs.


====High Transactional Costs====

The traditional real estate market entails high transactional costs, mainly because many agents such as middlemen, brokers, taxes and real estate agents go into action, inflating the final price.
The final cost of transacting a property can be inflated up to more than 22% of the real value of the property, an extra cost that can be eliminated with Leaxcoin technology.


====Integrity and Security====

The decentralized nature of Leaxcoin guarantees that stored records will not be tampered with or controlled by a single source, avoiding fraud, insecurity, loss and/or duplicity of documents in the real estate processes.


====Time and Cost Savings====

In the traditional real estate market, the process of transferring a property might take months due to the several parts involved, as well as the need to repeatedly verify all the documents in its different stages.


====Access to Foreign Investors====

Many foreigners interested in investing in real estate encounter considerable difficulties, mainly in long-distance real estate negotiations.

Depending on each jurisdiction (country, state or city), the purchase process runs into many difficulties, as there are details about the negotiations such as financing, security, regulations and fees, together with all the bureaucracy to be seriously considered.

Usually, it is necessary to hire real estate professionals to analyze all the documents in order to check any legal impediment, request debt clearance certificates and prevent fraud. All this prevents foreign investors from proceeding with the transaction.


=New Experiences in Real Estate Transactions=

==The Solution==

'''An ecosystem, the evolution in of the GLOBAL real estate market, a kind of bridge to connect the traditional real estate market to the blockchain via the Leaxcoin platform.'''

The global public can trade and transact all their properties and real estate processes, with no borders or foreign and geographical delimitations.

<blockquote>All this in a GLOBAL COMMUNITY format and totally DECENTRALIZED!<blockquote>


==Platform and Ecosystem Leaxcoin==

Everybody together, a global community, an ecosystem:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| INVESTORS
! scope="col"| NEGOTIATORS

|-
|}

A comprehensive and integrated ecosystem, which facilitates the real estate process transition to the blockchain through the Leaxcoin platform and ecosystem.

<blockquote> '''An ultimate solution that hosts all the real estate processes.''' </blockquote>

Developed to be user-centered, the Leaxcoin ecosystem makes it possible to unify the cryptographic and the whole traditional investment processes, making it user-friendly, faster, safer and less bureaucratic.

By becoming a user-friendly ecosystem of real estate Blockchain products, the Leaxcoin platform, along with the efforts of our community, will allow an easy and simple way of interaction in the real estate transactions in a decentralized service.

[[File:Images/plataform.png|Leaxcoin Plataform.]]

'''THE LEAXCOIN ECOSYSTEM WILL FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS'''


===Property Registry===

'''PROPERTY REGISTRY LEAXCOIN'''

Our aim is to ensure the feasibility of the real estate transfer. We can make the entire process safe, fast and protected by the Blockchain technology.

The whole process will be carried out in conjunction with our global community, as it is through the work and support of everyone that we will make it possible.

After all, the whole environment of the Leaxcoin platform is intended for communities, having tools, applications and solutions to a seamless integration with real estate registry offices, notaries and governmental institutions, complying with the jurisdiction of each place.

'''The Leaxcoin platform is protected by blockchain and the security of information and documents is our number one priority!'''

<blockquote> ''' “We have created an encrypted, unaltered and protected database.” '''<blockquote> 

The real estate experience will be simple, easy and intuitive – as well as safe, as we mentioned
above.

We can claim that we are a large Global Community, building a bridge to integrate the Leaxcoin platform with real estate organizations and registrars, complying with the jurisdiction of every country, state or city – thus guaranteeing authenticity and legal legimacy.

We can only succeed through the community and with its work. Together we can go much further and make this integration with the Leaxcoin technology possible in real estate transactions! In this way, we will be the best global reference with our tireless efforts to have all the regulations approved and used for real estate transactions integrated with our Leaxcoin platform.

We are committed to guarantee that all the services will be in compliance with all the government regulations in each jurisdiction, always looking for quick and effective ways to eliminate risks and fraud.


===Smart Contract===

The Leaxcoin platform is an important application of the blockchain technology in the form of Smart Contracts. These contracts are self-fulfilling agreements between the network members. Any information entered into these contracts is automatically treated according to a previously agreed protocol.

As this protocol is the only transaction arbiter, it can be carried out in a transparent way, free from conflicts, without high costs and time consuming intermediaries or other verification processes.

[[File:Images/smart_contract_plataform.png|Real Estate Contracts]]


====Real Estate Contracts====

'''REAL ESTATE CONTRACTS LEAXCOIN'''

Our global Leaxcoin contract platform consists of a system whose model allows contract managers to use a personalized smart contract to meet the specific needs of their real estate transactions – keeping in mind: always in compliance with the local statutes for their jurisdiction.

[[File:Images/registry.png|Registry]]

{| class="wikitable"

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| The Leaxcoin Smart Contract executes and closes the agreement
|-
|}


'''Here is an example:'''

In order to complete a property transaction, both users must have their Leaxcoin wallet. In this case, the seller draws up the purchase agreement and then inserts it through the Leaxcoin platform on the Blockchain.

The potential buyer receives this contract, analyzes every clause and may or may not accept it. If the buyer agrees with the contract, he/she sends the value referring to the property to the seller’s wallet address. However, this value will only be released when both users confirm that:

<blockquote> ''' Value received, but frozen. '''<blockquote> 

<blockquote> ''' The property register is in the name of the buyer. '''<blockquote> 

'''AT THE MOMENT THE TRANSACTION PAYMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE SELLER, THE LEAXCOIN PLATFORM TRANSFERS THE OWNERSHIP. ONCE CONCLUDED, THE SMART CONTRACT AWAITS A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM BOTH PARTS AND CHECKS IN THE CONFIRMATION, RELEASING THE SALE BALANCE AND THE PROPERTY REGISTRATION. SIMPLE, EASY AND SAFE!'''


====Property Listing and Opportunities====

'''PROPERTY LISTING AND OPPORTUNITIES LEXCOIN'''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| BUY
! scope="col"| SALE
! scope="col"| RENTAL
! scope="col"| NEW REAL ESTATE
|-
|}

The real estate listing Leaxcoin platform will allow owners to list their properties for rent or sale and distribute them to rental and sale popular sites on the web.

'''This also allows other investors and buyers who already use crypto-currency technologies to enter the real estate market.'''

[[File:Images/insert_proposal.png|Insert Proposal in Plataform]]

The system rewards sites and decentralized real estate brokers by appointing investors/buyers tocomplete the purchase process.

Every seller may provide a commission percentage. If the process is concluded, the platform will automatically make the percentage available on Leaxcoin via smart contracts.


====Crowd Sale Launches of Real Estate Developments====

'''TOKENIZATION REAL ESTATE'''

The crowdsale happens in the launching of a real estate project. It is conceived to generate funds for its development and investment.

''' At this stage, the investment in the real estate market is usually more profitable, having this market been previously accessible only to major investors: the construction of the enterprise. '''

This Leaxcoin platform module allows companies, developers and owners to tokenize fractions or percentages of their developments into real estate assets so as to sell them at the launching stage.


[[File:Images/api.png|Crowdsale Real State]]

'''Example:'''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| An incorporator intends to start selling a new enterprise at the launching stage of fraction or percentage.
|-
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| The enterprise project is checked and evaluated by our community
|-
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| The Leax platform tokenizes the enterprise or part of it virtually, dividing it into several fractions.
|-
|}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! scope="col"| Buyers and investors buy part of the enterprise according to the Leaxcoin rules, representing the fractions of the enterprise.
|-
|}


'''This is only viable with the help of Leaxcoin smart contracts, ensuring and making every moment of the sale campaign transparent.'''

The most interesting part of a crowdsale is what happens to the projects later. In many cases, they are bought and sold in the open market, obtaining a higher market value, that is, if the enterprise is as successful as they expect, the real estate can increase in value, generating considerable profits ahead.

They can buy a minimal percentage of the enterprise, because they believe in the potential for profits, either in the enterprise or in its sale. Such market used to be accessible only to major investors.

'''WALLET LEXCOIN'''

The Leaxcoin wallet will be fully developed on the Ethereum blockchain network, which is encrypted to avoid fraud and theft, having the following functions:

'''RECEIVING:''' receiving from anyone on the Leaxcoin network.

'''PURCHASE:''' buy Leaxcoins in the ICO period.

'''TRANSACTION:''' all the transactions will be registered on the Ethereum blockchain network, and users can verify every transaction, which cannot be deleted.

'''FEES:''' each transaction requires a fee (gas price), that is, a fee to the network maintenance and to reward the users who process these transactions on their computers (we use the Ethereum network), in order to keep the network incorruptible, safe, running and fully distributed.

<blockquote> ''' “Leaxcoin is pleased to be a true real estate community all over the world “ '''<blockquote> 


'''TOGETHER, WE JOIN FORCES TO BUILD A GLOBAL COMMUNITY OF THE BLOCKCHAIN REVOLUTION ENTHUSIASTS, PROVIDING NEW RESOURCES IN ORDER TO FOMENT THE REAL ESTATE WORLD REVOLUTION.'''


<blockquote> Leaxcoin, a community-based initiative, is a real open source project created by a global community of developers, engineers, executives, designers, academics, economists and blockchain enthusiasts, who have committed to including Leaxcoins into the main crypto currencies and making the decentralized technologies accessible to everybody. <blockquote> 

Our community’s main aim is to help with jurisdictional problems in every country, as well as with probable changes that might come along during real estate processes, either technological or related to regulations, and the only way out is to have a team committed to helping solve every legal problem.

All the implementation on the Leaxcoin platform will have the support of the community, always encouraged and actively rewarded for their involvement, as according to our distribution of Leaxcoin tokens, part of the fees will be passed on exclusively to those members and/or professionals, therefore stimulating the excellent platform members’ performance in serving and helping to clear up doubts and afflictions.

All Leax users are entitled to votes and opinions, at a 1-1 rate, one token per vote. Anyone in the community may contribute with ideas, feedback, codes, design, support and dissemination of the Leax project, since each location has its own jurisdiction, always discussed within the own internal community, forum and debates.


'''The community is organized and divided into Ambassadors, Developers and Managers.'''


==Ambassadors==

Ambassadors will be in charge of the management and legal agreements between the countries, cities and regions of their activity or specialty, helping and concluding agreements with real estate registrars involved in the Leax platform. These representatives will be maintained and chosen by the community members. They will provide maximum flexibility in face-to-face procedures, where the presence of a project representative is needed. As we know, laws are not fixed or intelligent, and have not evolved at the same speed as technology. In some countries, it is still necessary to deal with processes manually, according to the local jurisdiction. This is the role of the ambassador, who is always connected to the real estate regulating organs whenever necessary. The platform will be fully automated so as to reduce the necessary time for the real estate processes. 


==Developers==

Developers – all our codes will be totally open source, as we understand that a platform must be fully modulated and able to easily interact with any problem, in a righteous and innovating way. All new developers will be welcome to correct, update and create new solutions to the community. We will have a great core team behind and, with the help of everybody, will always have a platform that represents its members’ opinions. 


==Community Managers==

Community Managers will aim at helping the local community develop meetups, lectures, events, support and publicity of the Leaxcoin Project.

Every community needs some incentives to continue being fair and cooperative with all members. In order to ensure good social interaction with each other and encourage their contributions to the community, part of the platform fees will be allocated to the members who have positively helped the in the completion of any real estate process, such as a sale.

Our community will be rewarded with improvements on the platform. There will be a reward for denunciation of fake enterprises or malicious advertisements as well as to ambassadors, developers and managers of local communities and for successful real estate processes. 

All the platform fees will be fully subsidized at the first moment of the operation or until the tokens used for this purpose finish. After that, part of the fees paid to the Leaxcoin platform will be allocated to members directly connected to this transaction. All this process will be encoded in smart contracts, ensuring a mutual help and reward cycle.


=Growth Target=

'''No one can argue against the current Crypto Market force. In 2017, the market capitalization was evaluated in 400 billion dollars.'''

Cryptocurrencies challenge current economic structures and allow instant transactions with no interference of third parts, such as banks and governments. 

<blockquote>The largest cryptocoin is still the first, Bitcoin. Its only unit reached $20,000 in 2017</blockquote>

Once these cryptocoins enter the market, they turn into negotiable and exchangeable assets, very similar to the traditional stock markets for fiduciary money and other assets.

The demand for this market is high, some cryptocurrency exchanges have reached more than one billion dollar in daily turnover. This proves how a new market is climbing the financial ladder much faster than any of its predecessors.

Taking the volume of transactions into account (presented data in the current scenario), the growth of cryptocurrencies and the universalization of the real estate sector, we can predict very positive indicators of global negotiations, and this requires a platform prepared to guarantee the best experience for the users involved.

[[File:Images/negociations.png|Negociations]]



=Blockchain=

'''The Leaxcoin, uses the blockchain of Ethereum, use Ethereum, one of the most advanced and reliable blockchains to create safe smart contracts.'''

A Smart Contract is a self-executing computer protocol, made to facilitate and reinforce the negotiations and/or performance of a contract, providing reliability to online transactions. This type of contract was created with the popularization of cryptocurrencies, as it is a way of providing security and transparency to the transactions made by a currency.

The main aim of the Smart Contract is precisely to enable people who do not know each other, who may live on the other side of the world, to do business on the Internet with confidence, without requiring the interference of a central authority.

<blockquote>Unlike what happens to Bitcoin, with the evolution of Leaxcoin in the Ethereum blockchain, it is possible to reduce the transaction costs, obtain more transparency, security, agility and speed, without any probability of inactivity, censorship, fraud or interference from third parties.</blockquote>

The token was developed according to the main token pattern used by the Ethereum community, Smart Contract standard ERC20. You can keep your Leaxcoin tokens in the main wallets, such as MyEthWallet, Ledger Ethereum and the official Wallet of Ethereum network, called Mist.


=Incentives=

'''All buyers have free access to consult and interact with sellers through our Leaxcoin platform.'''

The purchases paid with Leaxcoin will have discounts on the final value of the transaction. In this way, we encourage using Leaxcoin to guarantee more agility in the process, making the payment much more quickly.

All the contracts are registered and saved on the Leaxcoin platform on the blockchain, ensuring that your contract will never get lost or tampered by third parts.

Any individual or real estate institution can access and advertise all their real estate, reaching investors in this market much more quickly.

<blockquote>It is a strong currency, unique to the real estate market, which can be integrated by any software, thanks to an external API that we will make it available.</blockquote>

We believe that users should be rewarded for contributing to the success of the platform. For every purchase/sale, rent of enterprises, all the parts involved will be rewarded.

[[File:Images/chart_1.png|Distribution]]

The Pre-ICO will be made for private investors and only after the completion of the anticipated sale will we make the ICO public, when everybody will be able to acquire the Leaxcoin tokens.

The accepted crypto coins will be Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin and others.

To purchase the Leaxcoin Token in the ICO period, you must visit the website in order to be informed about the start of sales in advance.

It is extremely important to sign up by email, as the purchase vacancies are limited, and there will only be 2 billion tokens available, for an initial value of $0,05 dollars both represented in 0,0001 ether. 


==Rates and Reserves for Community==

Every trade platform needs some time to come to maturity. As we know, the LEAX token has a limited number, and we believe that at the beginning of the operations, a platform cannot offer high costs to users.

With this view and with planning, our platform will use this reserve to subsidize the negotiations until the total balance allocated to reserves finishes and the negotiations pay their own fees. 


'''Our Ambassador program aims to create local communities for information dissemination and training with the platform evangelization in the country of operation.'''

The incentive to be an Ambassador will be the fees paid to the network advisors in each country. The raising of these subsidies will be possible.

The services done by all the ambassadors will be evaluated by the local users.

The fees and incentives will be divided into the following definitions:

{| class="wikitable"

==Bounty==

The Bounty program will reward the community members who help with translations, events, development and significant contributions to start up the project. We believe that we will evolve quickly with the help of the community and this incentive will come from Bounty.

The Leaxcoin offers several types of rewards, allowing anyone to get the Leax for their contributions to Leaxcoin. If you are a content creator or even a keen user, take a look at the percentages for marketing rewards.

The worksheet below shows the percentage and reward of each activity and how they will be distributed.

==Marketing==

Marketing – Relationships and culture development, costumer humanized support, fairs and events for the conversion of service providers and inbound/outbound marketing directed to the final user.

As we know, we live in an increasingly globalized world nowadays, with total exposure to so much information that it is difficult to reach investors.

For this very same reason, we will allocate part of the money to the platform marketing – both digital and traditional marketing in newspapers and specialized magazines.

Every project needs to be exposed and publicized, so part of the amount raised goes to the platform marketing planning so as to attract and form partnerships with the global media.

'''WE WILL DIVIDE THE PLATFORM MARKETING PLANNING IN THE FOLLOWING WAY (BOUNTY): '''

==Engineering and Development==

We use a set of DevOps practices, aimed at developers that actively interact with IT specialists and the mutual integration of their work processes. It is based on the practices of world leaders in software development.

Our team has successful extensive experience in the assurance of the quality of software products.

All the value allocated to development will help pay the creation of a fast, safe and intuitive platform, where anyone can invest in real estate.

The development of the platform of automated creation of contracts between the parts involved in the negotiation allows buyers to transfer ownership to another person on the platform, if they like.


==Api==

'''API''' – API is a set of routines and programming standards for access to a software application or Web-based platform. API stands for ‘Application Programming Interface’.

Google Maps is an excellent example in the API area. Through its original code, many other sites and applications use the Google Maps data and adapt them in the best way.

'''Didital Security''' – Part of the resources will be allocated to the prevention of cybercrimes.

'''Legal''' – In order to expand our work all over the countries, we will need to pay for the services of awyers or legal consultants. As every place of action has different laws, we will need to pay for this process.

The crypto-currency market is growing, as well as the virtual world. Considering that the numerous transactions have already been made on the Internet, everything makes us believe that almost all the market will be online in the near future.

The use of cryptocurrency is a trend, especially because of the agility and ease with which all the transactions are carried out.

Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin, claimed that the virtual currencies are causing a real economic revolution. And this could not be more true! One of the clear signs of the paradigm shift in cryptocurrency is that Germany, one of the countries with the highest authority on financial regulations, has already allowed Bitcoin as a means of payment.

Pedro Pinheiro, from Porto Business School (Portugal), remarked that he believes in a very promising future for the cryptocurrency market, confident that the virtual currency will keep growing and has already ensured considerable relevance in the global financial market.

Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, also thinks like that, foreseeing the virtual currencies as popular as the Euro or Dollar – and maybe replacing them.

Therefore, the Leaxcoin is an excellent opportunity for a promising gain, not only for the steady appreciation of cryptocurrencies, but also for the transaction of more profitable assets ever.

Although this is a market in operation, it brings countless benefits to the population in general. We are talking about a strong global currency, capable of transacting real estate and non-real estate easily, quickly, without bureaucracy and with strict security all over the world.

The perfect solution to all investors who want to guarantee their success in the business of the future.
