=Abstract=
There is no doubt that the real estate market is the most stable investment, with a greater margin of profits and lower risks of loss. This is what makes it so attractive to investors – be they experienced or novices.

Why is investing in real estate so safe? Basically, we can say that there is security in this type of investment for two reasons: great appreciation and hardly any depreciation over time. 

Besides, the majority of people not only see the purchase of a property as the guarantee of having a home but also as a way of owning an asset without having to worry about paying a rent, for instance.

In the end, it is much easier to realize the importance of having a property – whether for investment or for own use. Such certainty runs into one of the biggest problems we have nowadays: bureaucracy and the high costs of real estate, especially in big cities Concerning bureaucracy, we can say with optimism that technology and the new way of seeing transactions might change the scenario in few years. Financing approval only for those who have a high income and the need of numerous documents prevents the process from occurring in a fluid and optimized way for both sides.

Where does technology come to solve all this? The ones who know the new cryptocurrency and the Blockchain have already got an idea of the changes that are to come. The co-working platforms, like the ones we present in this document, facilitate all the processes and real estate negotiations – and the forecast is very optimistic. This type of transaction relies on the guarantee that they will not be tampered or altered, transforming the real estate process in something more intuitive, less bureaucratic and expensive, besides privacy, security and agility.

This management will be done on Leaxcoin platform, being extremely safe for both parts. Nowadays, we have real estate transactions that last up to six months but they could be handled in a matter of days or even in hours with the new technologies. Next, we introduce LEAXCOIN, a decentralized platform in a global community format with the evolution of Blockchain in the real estate industry.

=Executive Summary=

'''Imagine that you can conduct a real estate transaction without the need of any type of intermediation, either by banks or third parts.'''

This is a reality knocking at the door of new crypt-coin investors, just like Leaxcoin. Our main purpose is to have a focus of action through our platform and create a safe, fast and effective environment.

Moreover, our focus will be on the real estate sector, which suffers with cumbersome bureaucracy – real estate processes which hamper trade, for instance, and gradually become more expensive. Additionally, we will also work on real estate transfers and make the transparence of peer-to-peer transactions possible, always respecting the jurisdiction of every country where the negotiation takes place.

The cryptocurrency will be the used for payment within our platform. Through this process, real estate buyers and sellers will be able to negotiate their properties without any kind of intermediary and, at the same time, will receive their payment anywhere in the world with absolute guarantee.

'''This is what we call decentralized operations nowadays – which do not need any bank as a mediator.'''

The Leaxcoin has emerged to be much more than a simple transactional crypto currency, as well as a utility token that feeds the entire Leaxcoin platform. It comprises:

<blockquote>  
'''Market without intermediaries''' 
A non-bank and non-intermediary market. A reliable and autonomous community that will assist with all the transactions and conflicts or problems that might occur. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''ICO - Initial Coin Offering''' 
The Leaxcoin (LEAX) will be distributed to the ICO participants in a ratio of 1 LEAX to 0.0001 ETH based on the quotation of the day – in the initial contribution period, which is expected to start on 26/07/2018
</blockquote>

<blockquote>  
'''Limited Distribution''' 
The initial contribution period will last 90 days or less than 24 hours in case the o 1,000,000,000 LEAX ceiling is reached.
</blockquote>

The cryptocurrency Leaxcoin is much more than a platform! It is a global community where the real estate transactions are assisted and supported by several programmes, such as our Ambassador programme, in which the community ambassadors will offer all the legal solutions in every country of operation, thus establishing the integration with the Leaxcoin technology.

==Differential==

In the Leaxcoin community, we will promote solid integration with organizations and local real estate registry offices so as to have the Leaxcoin Smart Contract accepted as a legal buy-sell document, as well as a legal representation in the transfer of those properties.

Every change, partnership, innovation and creation of new products on our platform will always be voted by the community members, as we know that we will only create something really solid and memorable with the support and participation of our Leaxcoin community.

=The Current Scenario=

'''The current real estate scenario could not be better. There are over 217 trillion dollars for the area development! Only in 2017, the volume of global transactions reached 750 billion dollars!'''

[[File:Images/market.png|Real Estate Market.]]

Being aware of the dimension of this scenario, we believe that it offers a lot of opportunities, especially with the evolution of technology. After all, it has not been so explored yet. Who offers digital transactions to buy and sell real estates nowadays?

The development we have seen so far are just a drop in the ocean, compared to what we will see over the next few years.

The technology adopted by the real estate managers nowadays is the 2.0 version, where all the registry process of a property is done without any connectivity or standardization in several underdeveloped countries, every time generating higher taxes and slower processes.

'''WHAT IS TO COME IS WHAT WE WANT TO SET UP: A NEW WAY OF PROMOTING THE EVOLUTION OF THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR THROUGH LEAXCOIN, TO UPDATE THE WAYS THE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT, UPGRADING THESE PROCEDURES TO A 3.0 VERSION. THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE DECLARING, REGISTERING AND TRADING REAL ESTATES WITH ANYONE ON THIS PLANET.'''

In fact, technologies have exponentially grown and had an impact on billions of people all over the world. Whereas we had to go to agencies to transfer money, take out loans, even to pay our bills in the past, now we can have all this in one place. We just have to have our cell phones connected to the internet.

Technological advances have enabled the automation of the whole banking process, making services cheaper and more accessible to billions of people who could not access them before. However, the real estate sector is far behind the curve when it comes to adopting new technology. There is certainly still ample room for this, awaiting several opportunities.

In the current real estate market scenario, there are still disagreements between the parts with regard to contracts and transactions. Even a simple real estate lease is difficult to understand by both parts.

=What is Leaxcoin=

<blockquote> ''' "Forget about the problems about real estate transactions. A strong currency to be expanded all over the World!” '''<blockquote> 

'''LEAXCOIN'''

Leaxcoin is the cryptocurrency that comes with the solution to all the problems related to real estate transactions – whether in buying, renting, leasing, launching or even in registering properties.

The success of the Leaxcoin platform will be totally achieved with a global community, founders, ambassadors, members, real estate specialists and experienced developers, who integrate, with the necessary tools, into all the real estate processes and regulatory agencies of property registration for the blockchain. Everything complies with the countless jurisdictions of every country, state and city.

The Leaxcoin will be used for several things in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, we can say with absolute certainty that the Leaxcoin is a unique opportunity for growth, especially now, with the virtual currency market in constant and significant growth.

=The Tiring Experience of Real Estate Negotiations=

== The Problem ==

'''Despite the potential real estate profits, we know that it is not easy to buy a property.'''

In addition to a great amount of time to find what they want, keen buyers are forced to enter their data into portals and third parts, thus increasing the costs, reducing innovation and inhibiting potential investors and buyers of the sector.

When a transaction involves the purchase of foreign real estates, the process becomes more complicated and its conclusion drags on, which might take months of negotiation and a lot of bureaucracy and government paperwork until everything is concluded or unsuccessful, due to the tiring process.

Without considering whether a property is traded in its country of origin or not, it is true that its transaction – either the sale or the purchase or rent – brings several problems.

In order to maximize the benefits and minimize the losses that people might suffer, we have the solution to the problems through the efforts of Leaxcoin and our community.

===Current trade problems===

====High Capital Requirements====

Real state is usually very expensive and requires the investor/buyer to have high levels of capital. 
For this reason, this market ends up driving away small real estate investors.

====Strict Financial Regulations for Access to Finance====

Finance application is a time consuming process, especially because it is too bureaucratic.
Moreover, the requirement of documents to prove the investor’s buying power results in unnecessary costs.

====High Transactional Costs====

The traditional real estate market entails high transactional costs, mainly because many agents such as middlemen, brokers, taxes and real estate agents go into action, inflating the final price.
The final cost of transacting a property can be inflated up to more than 22% of the real value of the property, an extra cost that can be eliminated with Leaxcoin technology.

====Integrity and Security====
The decentralized nature of Leaxcoin guarantees that stored records will not be tampered with or controlled by a single source, avoiding fraud, insecurity, loss and/or duplicity of documents in the real estate processes.

====Time and Cost Savings====

In the traditional real estate market, the process of transferring a property might take months due to the several parts involved, as well as the need to repeatedly verify all the documents in its different stages.

====Access to Foreign Investors====

Many foreigners interested in investing in real estate encounter considerable difficulties, mainly in long-distance real estate negotiations.

Depending on each jurisdiction (country, state or city), the purchase process runs into many difficulties, as there are details about the negotiations such as financing, security, regulations and fees, together with all the bureaucracy to be seriously considered.

Usually, it is necessary to hire real estate professionals to analyze all the documents in order to check any legal impediment, request debt clearance certificates and prevent fraud. All this prevents foreign investors from proceeding with the transaction.

=New Experiences in Real Estate Transactions=

==The Solution==

'''An ecosystem, the evolution in of the GLOBAL real estate market, a kind of bridge to connect the traditional real estate market to the blockchain via the Leaxcoin platform.'''

The global public can trade and transact all their properties and real estate processes, with no borders or foreign and geographical delimitations.

<blockquote>All this in a GLOBAL COMMUNITY format and totally DECENTRALIZED!<blockquote>

==Platform and Ecosystem Leaxcoin==

Everybody together, a global community, an ecosystem:

A comprehensive and integrated ecosystem, which facilitates the real estate process transition to the blockchain through the Leaxcoin platform and ecosystem.

<blockquote> '''An ultimate solution that hosts all the real estate processes.''' </blockquote>

Developed to be user-centered, the Leaxcoin ecosystem makes it possible to unify the cryptographic and the whole traditional investment processes, making it user-friendly, faster, safer and less bureaucratic.

By becoming a user-friendly ecosystem of real estate Blockchain products, the Leaxcoin platform, along with the efforts of our community, will allow an easy and simple way of interaction in the real estate transactions in a decentralized service.

'''PROPERTY REGISTRY LEAXCOIN'''

Our aim is to ensure the feasibility of the real estate transfer. We can make the entire process safe, fast and protected by the Blockchain technology.

The whole process will be carried out in conjunction with our global community, as it is through the work and support of everyone that we will make it possible.

After all, the whole environment of the Leaxcoin platform is intended for communities, having tools, applications and solutions to a seamless integration with real estate registry offices, notaries and governmental institutions, complying with the jurisdiction of each place.

'''The Leaxcoin platform is protected by blockchain and the security of information and documents is our number one priority!'''

<blockquote> ''' “We have created an encrypted, unaltered and protected database.” '''<blockquote> 

The real estate experience will be simple, easy and intuitive – as well as safe, as we mentioned
above.

We can claim that we are a large Global Community, building a bridge to integrate the Leaxcoin platform with real estate organizations and registrars, complying with the jurisdiction of every country, state or city – thus guaranteeing authenticity and legal legimacy.

We can only succeed through the community and with its work. Together we can go much further and make this integration with the Leaxcoin technology possible in real estate transactions! In this way, we will be the best global reference with our tireless efforts to have all the regulations approved and used for real estate transactions integrated with our Leaxcoin platform.

We are committed to guarantee that all the services will be in compliance with all the government regulations in each jurisdiction, always looking for quick and effective ways to eliminate risks and fraud.

===Smart Contract===

The Leaxcoin platform is an important application of the blockchain technology in the form of Smart Contracts. These contracts are self-fulfilling agreements between the network members. Any information entered into these contracts is automatically treated according to a previously agreed protocol.

As this protocol is the only transaction arbiter, it can be carried out in a transparent way, free from conflicts, without high costs and time consuming intermediaries or other verification processes.

====Real Estate Contracts====

'''REAL ESTATE CONTRACTS LEAXCOIN'''

Our global Leaxcoin contract platform consists of a system whose model allows contract managers to use a personalized smart contract to meet the specific needs of their real estate transactions – keeping in mind: always in compliance with the local statutes for their jurisdiction.

[[File:Images/registry.png|Registry]]

{| class="wikitable"
|-

'''Here is an example:'''

In order to complete a property transaction, both users must have their Leaxcoin wallet. In this case, the seller draws up the purchase agreement and then inserts it through the Leaxcoin platform on the Blockchain.

The potential buyer receives this contract, analyzes every clause and may or may not accept it. If the buyer agrees with the contract, he/she sends the value referring to the property to the seller’s wallet address. However, this value will only be released when both users confirm that:

<blockquote> ''' Value received, but frozen. '''<blockquote> 

<blockquote> ''' The property register is in the name of the buyer. '''<blockquote>
